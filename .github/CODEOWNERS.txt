# CODEOWNERS file
# This file is used to define code owners for different parts of your repository.
# Code owners are automatically requested for review when a pull request affects the files they own.

# Specify the default code owner for all files in the repository.
# The asterisk (*) represents all files in the repository.
* @AlphaSweater

# If you want to specify owners for particular directories or files, you can add more rules.
# For example, if you want @AnotherUser to be the code owner of files in the /docs directory:
# /docs/ @AnotherUser

# You can also specify multiple code owners for different sections of the repository.
# For example, if you want both @AlphaSweater and @AnotherUser to be code owners for files in the /src directory:
# /src/ @AlphaSweater @AnotherUser
